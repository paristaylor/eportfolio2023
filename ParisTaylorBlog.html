<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;p&gt;In my blog post i am going to be writing about an up and coming trip to costa rica. A little bit of background on the trip...&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;So, when i was in australia i was getting stressed about my future. I have had a million stupid jobs from when i was 15 on. I've worked at a daycare, a summer camp, i've worked at dunkin donuts, i've been a housekeeper, i've cleaned schools, I worked in a factory moving palats and lifting boxes, i've worked at a front desk in a school answering questions, i've been a chef at a resturant and the list goes on and on. but i thought to myself that i have no experiance in my field really. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;i'm an environmental science major and sustainabilty minor. the only thing i have done in my field was i did some research in Fiji studying the coral reefs and i took some cool conservation classes in australia. This thought kind of sent me in a spiral thinking about my future and being able to get a job and so on.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself what can i do before i graduate that will look good on my reseme but also be an amazing once in a lifetime oppurtunity because i'm young and i don't want to waste my time doing something that i hate. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;so it came to me. I was going to spend my winter break in the jungle. I just had to decide how i was going to do this. first i was looking at the priogram world packing and living in either panama, brazil, chile, or peru working with animals somewhere deep in the jungle. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;time got away from me and i never really followed through on any of these leads. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;One day this semester a couple months ago I had some free time and just randomly decided to look at animal rehibilitation places in costa rica. i had alway wanted to go to costa rica but never had the oppurtunity yet. this was my perfect oppurtunity to spend an extended amount of time there seeing what the country had to offer while also getting my job experiance i needed for after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I ended up coming across this place called rescate animal rehibilitaion center. This was the place. I immediately called them and asked if i could work with them as an unpaid intern. to my surprise they said yes. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Not only did they say yes but i would also be able to live there and have 3 meals a day for free. It could not be more perfect. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;This was everything that i had been dreaming of. I was going to be able to live in the jungle of costa rica taking care of animals that they took in from poachers and logging and not only just do right for conservation but also have an amazing experiance to put on my resume.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;That day I said yes to the internship and it was set that i was going to be living with them for 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;A week after that i booked my flights.&lt;/p&gt; <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I decided to go a week early to travel around costa rica by myself and really do some self reflection.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;so this trip was not only going to be a work trip but it was also going to become a mental health trip.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Now that i am leaving in less that 24 hours it is actually becoming real now. I have been so beyond busy with school, my 2 jobs, medical issues and various other things that i genuinely have not even had a second to think about this amazing trip that i am going to be going on.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;That might be a good thing for the sole fact that i will be going completely solo and not know a single person in the entire country. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I have kind of traveled solo before but not quite to this extent. I have had to book and plan everything by myself. of course i am going to meet people along the way but i also need to be alone and really truly take a deep breath. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;My semester has been super hard in all aspects. I think that me not having reception and not being able to go on my phone will be great for some self reflection and kind of finding myself a bit. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;there has been some things this semester that kind of made me lose myself a bit and i think this trip is what i need to reconsider some things and think about the person i am and the person that i want to become. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;the fact that i am going to be alone on this trip with just me and my thoughts is the perfect oppurtunity for this to take place.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this trip is beyond exciting because there's nothing i love more in the world than traveling but i'm also terrified. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;i have no one to rely on but myself. I'm going to a country that i have never been to and don't speak the language and im a solo female traveler&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I am happy that i did not think about all these things while booking and just did it with out thinking because otherwise worry and doubts would have sept in a long time ago. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;But, back to the job experiance part. the fact that i<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>get to have to to my resume takes my stress and freakout level from a 100 to a 10. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;a little bit of context on how last minute i have been for this trip..&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;i'm leaving early friday morning and i just booked places to stay a couple days ago. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;im currently still in the process of packing and honestly that is not going well at all. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;my issue with that is that i'm basically packing for two separate trips in one. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;one set of clothes and things is for my solo week where i will be hiking and swimming and walking around towns and going to beaches. my other set of clothes is all clothes that i can wear to work while being around wild animals in the jungle with a plethera of bugs, plants, ect. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I've come to the conclusion that i will be majorly downsizing everything that i am bringing and that i will be feeding to the sterotype of a gross smelly backpacker. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;This makes me laugh but it is also very true. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I really pride myself in being the type of person that once i set my mind to something i make that happen no matter how hard that something is.&lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;when i told people of this dream of me living in the jungle working at an animal rehibilitation place everyone was just like yeah ok ok. but i made it happen. and for that i am really proud of myself. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Because my semester has been so hard towards the beginning i was beyond excited to leave and get out of america for a couple weeks but lately things have been turning around a bit for me and now i am kind of sad to leave my friends. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I am always leaving for weeks or months at a time it feels like and that's just the kind of person i am in my life right now. I totally believe that because i have nothing truly tieing me down right now it is the perfect time to leave and go on all these trips. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;but because i always leave on these trips it is very hard for me to keep relationships with people. I mean my close friends will always be there for me and be my friends no matter what and no matter how much i leave them. but it's the new relationships that i just cannot seem to keep because me leaving all the time is just too hard on them. me being on this trip will also make me think about this and if i really should even be thinking about relationships right now. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;I love change so much and i get extremely bored being in the same place for too long. this is why i like to travel around so much and this is also why i would be willing to move just about anywhere for a job when i graduate. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Also in the back of my head though if i got into a relationship that i truly was deep into i would be willing to stay for somebody or move for somebody. but then this makes me think am i abandoning my dream for a guy. I just don't know. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;all these questions i have and all these thoughts about what i truly want will hopefully be answered on this self reflection journey. &lt;/p&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p2">&lt;p&gt;Costa Rica Hopefully will open my eyes to what i truly want in life and give me some clarity. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2">&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p class="p2">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
